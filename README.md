# PROJECT_MAYHEM
Basic 3D game engine API, without graphical interface, built in C++, with OpenGL for advanced graphics and WinAPI for window management.

Aim of this project was to move from the first version of the engine [ [MaciejGrudziaz/ARENA.git](https://github.com/MaciejGrudziaz/ARENA.git) ] to more advanced one, with better graphics display, using OpenGL shaders and animated models.

Beacues of the difficulties encountered with the growth of the current API, the project was closed and moved to the next version [ [MaciejGrudziaz/PROJECT_APERTA.git](https://github.com/MaciejGrudziaz/PROJECT_APERTA.git) ] which is meant to be more universal [multi-platform] and which will have graphical interface for users to manage the contents of a game. 

Specially for this project, a special character editor was created [ [MaciejGrudziaz/CHARACTER_EDITOR.git](https://github.com/MaciejGrudziaz/CHARACTER_EDITOR.git) ], which transforms models files from external programs [like Blender] to **.mgr** format used by the engine.

The engine has also built-in collision detection functions, using GJK algorithm and basic physics interactions.

**Previous version:**
- **Project Arena (1.0)** [ (MaciejGrudziaz/ARENA.git)[https://github.com/MaciejGrudziaz/ARENA.git] ]

**New version:**
- **Project Aperta (3.0)** [ (MaciejGrudziaz/PROJECT_APERTA.git)[https://github.com/MaciejGrudziaz/PROJECT_APERTA.git] ]
